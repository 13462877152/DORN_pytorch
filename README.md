# DORN implemented in Pytorch 4.0


### Introduction
This is a PyTorch(0.4.0) implementation of [Deep Ordinal Regression Network for Monocular Depth Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02446). The train script will be aviliable after soon!

### TODO
- [x] DORN model in nyu and kitti
- [x] Training DORN on nyu and kitti datasets
- [ ] Results evaluation on nyu test set
- [x] Calculate alpha and beta in nyu dataset
- [x] Realize the ordinal loss in paper
